    <li><h3>Interstellar</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Interstellar was just so amazing to look at. 
                From the VFX and the music and sound design was just top notch!
                I loved every second of it and would recommend anyone to give it a watch</li>
        </ul>
    </li>

    <li><h3>Spider-Man 2 </h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Spider-Man 2 is my all-time favorite superhero movie. 
                The story beats and what i was watching felt truly like something out of a comic! 
                And peter's entire arch was believeable and empathetic as well.</li>
        </ul>

    <li><h3>Kung Fu Panda 2</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>I just loved the action and how tragic Po is, 
                and how he overcame such traumatic experiences. 
                And the villain is one of the most evil OS in dreamworks history!</li>
        </ul>

    </li>
    
    <li><h3>The Martian</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>I just really enjoyed the martian and the main characrter's journey of being saved throughout.
